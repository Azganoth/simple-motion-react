# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through installing `simple-motion-react` and creating your first transition animation.

## Installation

First, add the library to your project using your preferred package manager. The package name is `@simple-motion/react`.

```bash
pnpm add @simple-motion/react
```

or

```bash
npm install @simple-motion/react
```

## Quick Start: Fade Animation

The most common use case is animating a single component when it mounts and unmounts. We can achieve this with the `<CSSTransition>` component.

### 1. Add the Component

Create a component that toggles a piece of state to control the `in` prop of the `<CSSTransition>` component. We will use the `name` prop to assign base class names for the animation.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { CSSTransition } from "@simple-motion/react";
import "./styles.css"; // Your stylesheet

export const MyFirstTransition = () => {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)}>Toggle Element</button>

      <CSSTransition in={show} duration={500} name="fade" unmount>
        <div className="box box--ocean text">Hello, World!</div>
      </CSSTransition>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The example above is a simplified version of the pattern used in the `Fade` story for CSSTransition.

### 2. Add the CSS

For the `name="fade"` prop to work, you need to define the corresponding CSS classes in your stylesheet. These classes define the start, active, and end states of the animation.

```css
.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;
}

.fade-enter-from,
.fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}

.fade-enter-to,
.fade-leave-from {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

With these two parts in place, clicking the button will now gracefully fade the "Hello, World!" element in and out of view.
